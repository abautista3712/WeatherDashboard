WeatherDashboard is an interactive web application made to check the weather in different cities. The following data are displayed: city name, today's date, temperature, weather condition, humidity, wind, and UV index. All data points are taken from the OpenWeather API. A search field is provided at the bottom of the web app and accepts user input. If the input matches a valid data point on the OpenWeather API, the web app will update with the appropriate information. WeatherDashboard is hosted on GitHub and is designed to be mobile responsive.
